# Translating pdf files
In the notebook "Translation with Hugginface transformers" we build a translator class supporting English, French and German, a function that converts pdf files to txt files and a function that reads a txt file, translates it in a given target language and saves it as another txt file.
We also check the accuracy of our translations with nltk's bleu score.

The pdf file used as an example contains text from the following story: https://www.frenchtoday.com/blog/french-story/french-bread/.
You can also check the ouput txt and translated txt files.
